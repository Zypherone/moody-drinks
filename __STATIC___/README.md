- For every drink, users can save it to a Favourites category or a Try It Later category, and the data persists.
  - NB -[BUG] Removing a drink from the categories is currently unavailable in this version.
- The app is responsively designed to work across multiple devices.
- The interface is interactive and user friendly.
